Configuration Guide
Shop Points
Define your shops in Config.ShopPoints. Example:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lua
Copy
Edit
["general_store_1"] = {
    location = vector3(116.47, -1089.09, 29.23),
    pedModel = "mp_m_shopkeep_01",
    interactText = "Browse Items",
    currency = "cash",
    blip = { enabled = true, name = "General Store" },
    openHours = { start = 9, finish = 21 },  -- Opens at 9 AM and closes at 9 PM
    items = {
        { name = "water_bottle", label = "Water Bottle", price = 5, stock = 50 },
        { name = "sandwich", label = "Sandwich", price = 10, stock = 30 }
    }
}
Tax System
Configure tax settings in Config.TaxSystem. Example:

lua
Copy
Edit
Config.TaxSystem = {
    defaultTaxRate = 0.1,          -- Default tax rate (10%)
    shopTaxOverrides = {
        ["weapon_shop_1"] = 0.2    -- 20% tax rate for weapon shop
    },
    exemptJobs = { "police", "ems" },  -- Exempted jobs from taxes
    taxApplyDelay = 2000           -- Delay before tax is deducted after a purchase (milliseconds)
}
Stock Management
Enable or disable stock with the Config.StockSystem setting:

lua
Copy
Edit
Config.StockSystem = {
    enabled = true,
    restockTime = 3600,  -- Restock every 1 hour
    maxStock = {
        ["water_bottle"] = 50,
        ["sandwich"] = 30
    }
}
Quantity Selection (qb-input)
Players can choose how many items they want to purchase using qb-input. This allows precise control over item purchases, and total costs are calculated accordingly.




============== STEP 6 PAYMENT OPTIONS ============== THIS IS FOR SPECIFIC SHOPS, IF YOU WAN'T A SHOP TO EITHER ACCEPT BANK , CASH , OR MARKEDBILLS , MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE THE CORRECT CURRENCY SETTING IN THE CONFIG.LUA WHILE SETTING UP THE SHOP! :)
Payment Options
Players can choose to pay using cash or bank balance.
Bank payments are processed through okokBanking.
Commands
No commands are required for this resource. All interactions are handled through in-game NPCs and qb-menu interfaces.
